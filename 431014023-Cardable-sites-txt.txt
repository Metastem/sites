Confirming Apple is still cardable:
Dear Apple Customer,

The following products shipped on 05.04.2005. Your order should
arrive within 5 business days of shipment.
xxxxxxxxxxx

- Carded mini ipod
Apple is cardable, but in many cases you can only use a card from your own country.

they didnt ask me ccscan they shipped my psp and some games very easy...
in 24 hours

enjoy!!



Same bill means you use the same address for billing and for shipping, also refers
to AVS check (Address Verification System).

Yes you can use a CA card to card to NJ but just a little note - US apple store is
a much more strict on data verification than its other overseas stores.

Relógios.

Received shipment next day by noon via DHL.

[http://www.californiaspeedway.com/] Bought 6 Tickets to AMA Superbike race,
Tickets arrived regular mail a couple weeks prior to event. Received an email from
them a few days after receiving tickets, regarding the charges coming back, I never
responded. The tickets have no barcode or scanning type identification on them, I
don't see any way they could render the tickets void. I will find out in 1 week
when I go to the event and post info. I have a scan of one of the tickets if anyone
needs.

i just used US cvv and same last name as billing. i first order camera for 300$ and
took 32 hours to process and then once i recieved it i ordered a sony laptop $2,100
and procesed in 14 hours. same day it was processed.


TIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
a few pple PM me on how to card abesofmaine.com. well the only thing i did was i
had a fresh US cvv2 and on my shipping name i used the same last name as on cvv for
example if cardholder name is Jenn Rock on my shipping name i put John Rock.
understand..and on comment box itype a message that makes it seem like family -
related...for example i used a comment familiar to this....John Rock, please leave
store open on Thursday And Fridays now and call me as soon as you recieve this item
. Bye...that was a example of a comment u could use...once ur first order goes
through any other order u make to same shipping address processes fast.

Amazon.com is still cardable, but you need:
hacked account;
complete credit card with billing address (AVS).

Most customers use the same password in diferent sites, you can hack an account if
the hacked password is the same password in Amazon (almost any shop site use
passwords). Then you need a new email (yahoo.com hotmail.com etc). Change the email
(first see for new orders, and only use inactive accounts). If you made all, you
can card in Amazon.com. I carded $800 per order, but I try a first order of $100 or
$150.

There are brazilian cardable sites, that ship worldwide (books and cd's):
www.somlivre.com
www.siciliano.com
www.livrarianobel.com.br

You can use Mastercard with fake cvv in these three sites.


When card in walmart.com, you should use Amex to bypass Visa

Hey Yo'll ever read this book the "emporer's new cloths" this thread is like it no
~censored~ real sites with ~censored~ worth selling to make for you risk ya taking
lolololol some post sites you can card chocolates lololooooooooooooooooooool the
only good site in here is maybe http://www.apple.com and http://www.dell.com i took
from this thread http://www.dhanish.com thought i was gonna get me some GOLD!!!!! i
went there and got some for 8 bucks worth looooooooooooooooooooooool so for a
change today i will post a real cardable site and how to card it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so
all yo carders that been carding ~censored~ for a living and need better stuff go
right now to http://www.officemax.com like the past one month i carded it with
generated platinium amex's orders totalling $3000 max and $500 lowest if ya know
how to generate a dead platinium amex then card ya self some wicked stuff!!! so
here is goes first off buy something worth about 200 dollars max after it gets
shipped buy anything ya want and i mean anything am gonna leave logs here just so
you know am not lieing so please get yaself some cash!!!! use a fresh drop never
used on that site will work best, bill and ship to your drop believe it or not it
will WORK!!!!!!!!! then put your drop as card holder for cvv2 put 0000 thats what i
use make sure this is a platinium amex. So do all this right like i have said and
you will get an order confirmation with subject "orderinformation" in ya email the
order status should be "opn" next day you should get another one with same "opn"
when this happens you should get one more saying "dlv" when you get this brov let
your drop know asap! he has to be there in person to sign cos officemax does not
leave on door or anything like that!!!!! someone has to sign out for em when your
order goes through use same account login and pass and SAME card number use same
